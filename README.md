PLA

It's the question 16 from machine learning course https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw1/hw1.pdf 

Implement a version of PLA by visiting examples in fixed, pre-determined random cycles
throughout the algorithm. Run the algorithm on the data set. Please repeat your experiment for
2000 times, each with a different random seed. What is the average number of updates before the
algorithm halts? Plot a histogram ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram ) to show the
number of updates versus frequency.
